	<h1>The Concept of the Internet </h1>
	<p>The Internet is the byproduct of the Red Scare and the Soviets'
	advancement in technology. Some regard October 4, 1957 (Sputnik launch) as the day the
	internet was born. Because it was on this day, the US of A decided that
	it was finally time to take tecnology to the next level.</p>	
        
    	<h2> The Early Years</h2>
	  <ul>
	    <li> Years: 1957-1960
	      <p> USSR launches Sputnik, Bell Labs invents the motem as well as the creation of ARPA.
	      <p/>
	    </li>
	    <li> Year: 1960-70
	      <p> Kleinrock invents packet switching at MIT. JC Licklider thinks of networked computers, becomes head of ARPA. In the years
              of 1964-67 Paul Baran and Donald Davies develop packet switching message blocks. At the peak of the 60s, Internet Protocols
              were invented.
	      </p>
	    <li> Year: 1970-80
	     <p> Nothing much hear, more implementing Internet Protocl as well as the first registry ever created. Fun Fact: Ethernet was
             invented during this decade
	     </p>
	    </li>
	    <li> Year: 1980-90
	      <p>ARPAnet transitions to the superior TCP/IP. Linus Torvald creates linux and advocates for open software sharing and
              development.
	      </p>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
        <p>So what does that mean for the internet in the new coming century? A lot of advancement for websites such as Google,
           Youtube, Twitter, you name it!
